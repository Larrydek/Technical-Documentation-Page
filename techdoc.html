                Life is beautiful and complex, but can be studied as another science phenomenom. In this case life is based on small living things called cells, but this cells are made of smaller biological systems that are made of molecules that are made of atoms (which are the result of star explosions). However, this is not a full course, but we will try to review the conceps and principles that made life possible, and to see the general vision of the repeating patterns of stardust that generates this complex cycle called life

                Before to continue this review, you have to take a look on atomic structure. The proton is the particle that has positive charge and lie in the nucleus of the atom between the neutron (attached by the strong nuclear force, which is significantly stronger that electromagnetic force) electron is the particle of the atom that has negative charge. </p>
            
                <ul>
                    <code><strong>Being p = protons, e = electrons, n = neutrons:</strong>
                        <li>
                        p - e = charge of the atom
                        When charge > 0 is called <strong>CATION</strong>
                        When charge < 0 is called <strong>ANION</strong>
                       </li>
                       <li>When p ≠ n we are talking about <strong>ISOTOPES</strong>
                       </li></code>
                </ul>
                
            <p>
                You always have to take present the concept of electronegativity. This phenomenom is basically the desire that an atom has to win or lose an electron. This desire depends on the atomic number (Z = number of protons in the nucleus) and the atomic radius of the element. You could think that bonds between atoms are the action of electronegativity taking place when 2 or more atoms meet in space. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Let's suppose there are 2 atoms close to each other of the corresponding elements A and B.
            </p>
              
                 
                <code>If electronegativity of A ≈ B, and are big ones there will be a <strong>COVALENT BOND</strong>, because both atoms want the other's electron (e.g. 2 non metals like Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Halogens).
                    
                    If electronegativity of A ≈ B, and are little ones there will be a <strong>METAL BOND</strong>, because they want to donate its electron to the other atom. This forms a electron cloud of delocalizated electrons and this is the cause of electric conductivity on metals when subjected to a potential difference (e.g. metals like Iron, Cooper, Zinc) .

                    If electronegativity of A>>B, there will be an <strong>IONIC BOND</strong>, because the atom with the highest electron afinitty will "steal" the mayority of the electron cloud that forms the chemical bond, living A with negative charge density and B positive. (e.g. salts like NaCl, CaBr)
                     
                    If electronegativity = 0, you probably are talking about Noble Gases (Group 18). This atoms are not likely to react and are inert because they don't want to share or steal electrons. They have the full octet of electrons in it's outer shell.

                The mayority of living species have Carbon, Hidrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus in its composition, but there are a special one: Carbon.

            <p>
                This 4 electrons make 4 bonds possible, giving to the atom the chance of forming more complex chains of atoms and geometric arrangements, which are the reason of many physical, chemical, and biological phenomena.

                Scientists need to draw chemical structures in an efficient way and easy to understand, but depending the situation they have to choose which style is better:

            <code><strong>Lewis Structure:</strong> All atoms and bonds are explicity drawn, but are only practical for small molecules.
                <strong>Partially Condensed Structure:</strong> C-H and other bonds that aren't of interest aren't drawn. This simplify the analysis focusing on the atoms you want. 
                <strong>Condensed Structure:</strong> Single bonds are not drawn. Groups of atoms are clustered together to resume information.
                <strong>Molecular Formula:</strong> This only shows the number of each element in the molecule, but avoiding structural information. 
                <strong>Bond-Line Structure:</strong> Each line represents 2 electrons forming a bond between carbon atoms, simplifying the drawing process and making easy to read.
            </code>
            
            <p><strong>Formal charge</strong> is the charge of a single atom and is calculated as follows: </p>
                <code>nº of electrons in the valence shell - nº free electrons - nº bonds
                    To specify charge you can draw a <strong>"+"</strong> or <strong>"-"</strong> around the atom. </code>
            <p>
                You have to choose wisely depending on what you want to emphasize, and depending the size of molecule to study.

            <p><strong>Chirality:</strong> This concept is always present in nature and is related to the mirror image of an object. For many objects its mirror image is <strong>superimposable</strong> if they have planes of simmetry, is <strong>identical</strong>, but if don't its mirror image will be <strong>unsuperimposable</strong>, and speaking about molecules it will be called <strong>chiral</strong>. The most common source of molecular chirality is the presence of a carbon atom bearing four different
                groups. There are two different ways to arrange four groups around a central carbon atom. These two arrangements are nonsuperimposable mirror images.</p>
                <p>A chirality center is a tetrahedral atom connected to 4 different groups (because that center doesn't have simmetry), in this chemistry this atom is mostly carbon</p>
            <p><strong>Isomers</strong> are compounds with the same molecular formula but that still differ from each other. To identify and communicate the difference between connections chemists Cahn, Ingold and Prelog developed a system to assign a configuration (called R or S) based on atomic number. 
                The atom with the highest atomic number is assigned the highest priority (1), while the atom with the lowest atomic number is assigned the lowest priority (4). You have to rotate the molecule so the lowest priority atom is directed behind the page, and finally you have to see if the sequence 1-2-3-4 is clockwise <strong>(R configuration)</strong> or counterclockwise <strong>(S configuration)</strong></p>
            <ul><code><li><strong> Constitutional Isomers:</strong> Different order of connectivity of atoms. Different properties.</li>
                <li><strong>Stereoisomers:</strong> Different spatial arrangement of atoms</li><ul class="stereo_list"><li><strong>Enantiomers:</strong> They are mirror images to each other and are non-superposable. All the stereocenters are changed to the other configuration. They exhibit identical physical properties but opposite optical activity </li><li><strong>Diastereomers:</strong> They are not mirror images to each other but some stereocenters are changed to the other configuration. Its physical properties are different because of its different intermolecular force due to different spatial arrangement.</li></ul></code></ul>

                The building blocks of this chemistry is made up arrangements of certain atoms (with certain physical environment) that are present in various substances. The encounter of these substances in space generates a tendency to seek a balance by minimizing their energy. This is what origins what we called reactions. Those common groups are the following:

               This course won't be large enough to explain the properties of each functional group but we are going to explain how to use them to our benefit in order to build molecules starting from different ones. This is the art of synthesis, there are so many possibilities depending your <strong>reagents</strong> (starting compounds), the <strong>solvent</strong> (protic, aprotic, acidic, basic) and the molecule you want to achieve. Is always recommended to start with 1-step synthesis and keep in mind simple reactions such as <strong>Acid-Base</strong>, <strong>SN1 & SN2</strong> (Nucleofilic Substitutions), <strong>E1 & E2</strong> (Elimination) and <strong>Aditions</strong> in order to develop experience to reach multi-steps synthesis and work with more complex functional groups and reagents. 
            </p>
            <p>Example of transformations:</p>

            <p> 
                To reach the goal in organic chemistry you have to learn to think teoretically but also you must improve your practical lab skills. We have seen that reactions have unwanted products and intermediates that could be gases or toxic substances. You need to know how to manipulate it. You shouldn't work alone in the lab and you must always wear lab coat, security glasses, and latex/nitrile gloves. Security is first.

                This techniques involves very calibrated machines and that technical details wont be developed in this section. These methods are used to determine what kind of compound we have when we don't know it, but isn't that easy. Some methods give us the molecular formula of the compound(MS), others what kind of functional groups we have (IR), and other the structure or neighboring atoms (NMR). We will explain the fundamentals and applications because are very useful on chemical synthesis.

                According to wave-particle duality (de Broglie 1924) light is an electromagnetic radiation that exhibits both behaviors. When viewed as a wave, consists on a perpendicular oscillating electric and magnetic fields as shown above:

Light excits bonds between the compounds and the spectrometer can measure those resulting vibrations. Depending on the wavelenght of this vibrations we can determine what kind of funcional group has been excited.

                Another machine here. There we have a particle acelerator that receives particles previously ionized of our compound. (It needs to be ionized because the acelerator works with a electric field). Charged particles hits a plate and depending on what distance they travelled you can calculate its weight, and then its molecular formula.
